# GasGuard
GasGuard is an open-source static analysis suite for [Stellar/EVM] developers. Built with a scalable Nest.js backend, it provides real-time scanning for Rust, Solidity, and Vyper contracts. It identifies gas-heavy patterns and suggests automated refactors, reducing transaction costs by 15-30% while maintaining high auditability.
